Dr. Kundu is an expert in Analytical Heat Transfer, Solar Collector, Thermal Insulation, Extended Surface Heat Transfer, Fin and Tube heat Exchanger, Biological Heat Transfer, Electro-Osmotic Flow, etc. and has authored 95 research papers in numerous International Journals for the same. Most of the papers were published with sole or first authorship. Dr. Kundu has received a GATE Fellowship during his M.E. Program from UGC, India and an Institute Scholarship during his Ph.D Program from IIT Kharagpur. In 2001 Dr. Kundu’s biography was published in the Marquis Who’s Who in the world. 
               <br>
                Dr. Kundu started his career as a Senior Lecturer at the Jadavpur University in January 2003. He also worked as Research Professor in School of Mechanical Engineering at the Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea as a part of the Brain Korea 21 Program (2010-2012). Besides this, Dr. Kundu was also a visiting Research Professor in Hanyang University (2013-2015 & 2017) and Michigan Technological Institute (2016).  Dr. Kundu teaches many courses at the Graduate and Undergraduate levels, which include subjects as Conduction Heat Transfer, Computational Heat Transfer and Heat and Mass Transfer at the Graduate level and Heat Transfer, Thermal Engineering, Engineering Drawing, Prime Mover for Electrical Systems, and Steam Turbines at the Undergraduate Level. Dr. Kundu was awarded the Outstanding Faculty Award (Venus International Foundation, 2015), The Teacher’s Excellence Award under the category, Number of Research Papers/Books published (Confederation of Education Excellence, 2015). Dr. Kundu has also guided many of his students in their Ph.D Thesis and PG Thesis.
