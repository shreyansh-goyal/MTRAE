                    Reading success stories of great people stimulates motivational enzyme within us and we all wish to emulate them on the path of success. Such is the story of man who has carved niche in his own way and has proved himself like a phoenix whose name is Dr. Ravi Kumar Gupta.
                    Dr. Ravi Kumar Gupta is Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering Department at Manipal University Jaipur. He did his schooling from Government Secondary School, Karauli and is a graduate in Mechanical Engineering and holds a Masters degree in Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing from India’s prestigious institute Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad.
                    Someone should never view challenges as a disadvantage. Instead, it's important to view them as stepping stone as the experience of facing and overcoming adversity is actually one of the biggest advantages. Dr. Ravi faced extreme hardships during his Mechanical Engineering as he belonged to a remote village but as it is said that “Fortune favours the Brave” his uncle Dr. Pitam Chand helped him in learning academics and day to day activities. Being from a government school, a graduate in Mechanical Engineering and working with the private industries, getting admission in Motilal Nehru Institute with full scholarship was a dream coming true which  boosted his morale.
                    Dr. Ravi Kumar entrenched a Memorandum of Understanding between Manipal University Jaipur and Ecole Centrale de Nantes which is in France for Academic Collusion. He even visited Canada, France, UK, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Switzerland, Greece, Brussels, Netherlands and Spain for Research work which is backed by Manipal University Jaipur.
                    Everyone goes through diverse and numerous experiences during one’s life. Each record captures a different turning point in the life, and such a turning point came into the life of Dr Ravi when he was put forth a job offer from the campus and at the same time received a call from the most premium research institution of India “Institute of Science Bangalore” for admission in Ph.D. Since it is difficult to get admission in the Institute and has been bestowed by a life time opportunity he decided to go for Institute of Science Bangalore under the guidance of Prof. Balan Gurumoorthy.
